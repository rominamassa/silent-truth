  <h1>Final Revelation</h1>
  <p>As you stand amid the protest at the civic center, a figure steps forward from the crowd. The tension eases as the person reveals a shocking truth:</p>
  <p>"I'm the missing journalist you've been tracking. I've been forced into hiding because my story threatens to expose the everyday human rights violations that plague our society."</p>
  <p>You realize with a start that not only have you uncovered the public right to freedom of expression being exercised by these protestors, but the journalist himself is suffering a violation of that same rightâ€”his voice is being silenced by those in power.</p>
  <p>This is your final mission: help get his story out. By amplifying his voice, you can spark the change that our society so desperately needs. But how to start? You must begin by understanding. Continue your journey and explore the most relevant schools of thought in human rights to discover where you stand.</p>
