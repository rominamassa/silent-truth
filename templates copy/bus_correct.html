  <h1>Correct!</h1>
  <p>You decide to head to the nearby bus station—where bus line 73 stops—setting you on the right path to continue your investigation.</p>
  <p>At the bus station, you encounter Maria, the station attendant, who recounts how a commuter was recently refused boarding solely because of his appearance—an act of discrimination that clearly violates his right to freedom of movement.</p>
  <p>Leaving the station, you notice a quaint newspaper stand that also sells coffee. You decide to grab a cup and take a moment to reflect on everything you've learned.</p>
  <p>As you sip your coffee, a bold headline on the newspaper catches your eye: "<strong>Protest Against Discrimination at the Civic Center Today</strong>." The article explains that a protest is being held at a civic center just a short walk away—a protest born out of citizens' determination to fight discrimination.</p>
  <p>Realizing that this new lead could expose further human rights abuses and connect to the broader story, you feel compelled to follow it.</p>
